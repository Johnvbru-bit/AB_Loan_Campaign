## Project Description: Customer Churn Prediction for Banking Services

### Problem Statement:
In the competitive banking industry, understanding and mitigating customer churn—when customers leave for another service provider—is crucial for maintaining a loyal client base. Identifying the factors that influence a customer's decision to leave allows management to focus on improving services that matter most to their clients.

### Objective:
As a Data Scientist at the bank, I developed a neural network-based classifier to predict whether a customer is likely to leave within the next six months. By analyzing various customer attributes, the model aims to provide insights that can help the bank enhance customer retention strategies.

### Data Overview:

The dataset includes customer information such as unique ID, surname, credit score, location, gender, age, tenure, number of products, account balance, credit card ownership, estimated salary, and activity status. The target variable, "Exited," indicates whether a customer left the bank (1) or stayed (0). This project seeks to leverage these data points to accurately predict churn and inform strategic improvements.
